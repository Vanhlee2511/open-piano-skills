  # ============================================
  # THEORY
  # ============================================

  chord_triad_structure:
    2: "Explain: Major triad = major third + minor third. Formula: 4-3 semitones."
    3: "Derive all 12 major triads with the 4-3 formula. C major = C-E-G."
    4: "Explain: Minor triad = minor third + major third. Formula: 3-4 (reverse of major)."
    5: "Derive all 12 minor triads. C minor = C-Eb-G."
    6: "Explain: Diminished = two minor thirds (3-3). Unstable, wants to resolve."
    7: "Explain: Augmented = two major thirds (4-4). Floating, symmetrical."
    8: "Practice inversions: 1st inv = third in bass, 2nd inv = fifth in bass. For all types!"
    9: "Explain triads in context: I, IV, V = major. ii, iii, vi = minor. vii° = diminished."
    10: "Complete understanding: Instantly recognize and derive any triad type."

  chord_extensions_basic:
    2: "Explain: Sus4 = third becomes fourth. Csus4 = C-F-G instead of C-E-G."
    3: "Explain: Sus2 = third becomes second. Csus2 = C-D-G."
    4: "Practice sus4 → major resolution. The fourth 'falls' to the third."
    5: "Explain 7sus4: Seventh chord without third. G7sus4 = G-C-D-F."
    6: "Explain add chords: Note added to triad WITHOUT seventh. Cadd9 = C-E-G-D."
    7: "IMPORTANT: Distinguish add9 from 9. C9 HAS seventh, Cadd9 does NOT!"
    8: "Clearly distinguish: Cadd9 (C-E-G-D) vs. C9 (C-E-G-Bb-D)."
    9: "Recognize add11 and add13 chords."
    10: "Recognize sus/add in pop, rock, gospel. Almost every pop song uses them!"

  chord_seventh_structure:
    2: "Explain: Dominant7 = major + minor seventh. G7 = G-B-D-F. Formula: 4-3-3."
    3: "Understand the tritone in V7 (B-F in G7). It creates tension → V7-I resolution."
    4: "Explain: Major7 = major + major seventh. Cmaj7 = C-E-G-B. Soft jazz sound."
    5: "Explain: Minor7 = minor + minor seventh. Cm7 = C-Eb-G-Bb. Warm, gentle."
    6: "Understand ii-V-I: Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7. THE jazz cadence!"
    7: "Explain: Half-diminished (m7b5) = diminished + minor 7. Cm7b5 = C-Eb-Gb-Bb."
    8: "Explain: Fully-diminished = diminished + diminished 7. Cdim7 = C-Eb-Gb-Bbb. Symmetrical!"
    9: "Distinguish all 5 seventh chord types: dom7, maj7, min7, ø7, dim7."
    10: "Professional understanding: Recognize seventh chords in jazz, pop, classical."

  chord_extensions_advanced:
    2:
      default: "Explain: Ninth chord = seventh chord + ninth. C9 = C-E-G-Bb-D."
      gospel: "9th chords are THE foundation in gospel! Explain C9 and Cadd9."
      jazz: "Ninth chord = seventh chord + ninth. Basis for more tensions."
    3:
      default: "Distinguish: C9 (dom), Cmaj9 (maj7+9), Cm9 (m7+9)."
      gospel: "In gospel often Cadd9 instead of C9. Fuller, but without the b7."
      jazz: "C9, Cmaj9, Cm9 - all three in ii-V-I progressions."
    4:
      default: "5 notes = voicing decision. Often omit the fifth."
      gospel: "In gospel: Often all notes for full sound!"
      jazz: "Omit fifth, bassist has it."
    5: "Explain alterations: b9, #9, b5 (#11), #5 (b13). Increase tension!"
    6: "Explain 7alt: G7alt can have b9, #9, b5, #5 - all alterations possible."
    7: "Understand altered scale: 7th mode of melodic minor. Play over 7alt."
    8: "Upper structures: E major over C = C13. Triad over bass note!"
    9: "Tritone substitution: Db7 instead of G7 (same tritone, different bass)."
    10: "Professional application: Combine 9/11/13, alterations, upper structures."
