  # THEORY SKILLS
  # ============================================

  scale_diatonic_formula:
    2: "Understand: C major = white keys C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. A minor = white keys A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A."
    3: "Learn the formulas: Major = WWHWWWH, natural minor = WHWWHWW (W=Whole, H=Half)."
    4: "Understand relative relationship (A minor = C major) and parallel relationship (A minor = A major with b3, b6, b7)."
    5: "Derive all 12 major and natural minor scales using the formulas."
    6: "Harmonic minor: Raise the 7th degree for the leading tone. A harmonic minor = A-B-C-D-E-F-G#-A."
    7: "Melodic minor: Raise 6th and 7th ascending, natural descending. In jazz: Always raised."
    8: "Understand circle of fifths, all key signatures, enharmonic relationships (F#=Gb)."
    9: "Compare all three minor forms: natural (modal), harmonic (leading tone), melodic (smooth)."
    10: "Complete mastery: Chords on each minor form, modal relationships to major."

  scale_pentatonic_blues_formula:
    2: "Pentatonic = 5 notes, no half steps = 'no wrong notes'. Major: 1-2-3-5-6 from major scale."
    3: "Black keys = Gb major pentatonic. C major penta = C-D-E-G-A."
    4: "Minor pentatonic: 1-b3-4-5-b7. A minor penta = A-C-D-E-G = same notes as C major penta!"
    5: "Understand relative relationship: Every major penta has a relative minor penta (3 semitones lower)."
    6: "Blues scale = minor pentatonic + blue note (b5). A blues = A-C-D-Eb-E-G."
    7: "Major blues (1-2-b3-3-5-6) vs. minor blues (1-b3-4-b5-5-b7). Combine both!"
    8: "Pentatonic-chord assignment: C penta over Cmaj7, Am7; D penta over Cmaj7 for tension."
    9: "Pentatonic substitutions and stacking for modern sounds."
    10: "Complete pentatonic/blues theory: All applications over all chord types."

  scale_chromatic_structure:

    9: "Understand chromatic tonality (20th century)."
    10: "Master complete chromatic theory."

  mode_church_modes:
    2: "Modes = scales from same note material but different starting notes. D Dorian = C major notes from D."
    3: "Ionian = major (1st mode), Aeolian = natural minor (6th mode). You already know these!"
    4: "Dorian (2nd): Minor with major 6 - jazz minor sound. Mixolydian (5th): Major with minor 7 - dominant sound."
    5: "Lydian (4th): Major with #4 - floating, magical (film music). Typical over Maj7#11."
    6: "Phrygian (3rd): Minor with minor 2 - Spanish, Flamenco. Locrian (7th): Diminished - over m7b5."
    7: "Play all 7 modes in C major and describe the character of each mode."
    8: "Characteristic tones and avoid notes: Lydian=#4 (character), Ionian=4 (avoid over Imaj7)."
    9: "Modal cadences and modal interchange (borrowing chords from parallel modes)."
    10: "Professional modal application: Spontaneously play any mode over appropriate chords."
